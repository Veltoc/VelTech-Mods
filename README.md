# Mods controls:
## Time 
[Home] pauses time

[Page Down] will now allow you to go down incrementally with 10 stages of speed 

[Page up] works as the return to normal switch, but also will toggle full slow mode.

## Custom Smoke
[pause/break] opens a slider menu, adjust the values with the slider to get the desired color and click apply. 
*Note, this is the alternative due to secondary color being inaccessable with the current obfuscation.
